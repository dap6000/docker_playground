#LAMP Stack Local Development Container
I've had a _good enough_ process for local development for many years now. But once I started paying attention I noticed I was losing several hours of  productivity in troubleshooting and debugging my local dev environment when  something went wrong. This didn't happen often. But when it did happen it was  frustrating. And it seems like codifying the state of my dev environment in a  container would be a long term win.

I'm a developer. Not an ops person. Ops work is slow. Especially for those of us not terribly familiar with Unix and server admin stuff anyway. The good news is I'm going to try to document my process here in hopes of reinforcing some synaptic connections in my own brain as well as possibly providing useful info for others new to Docker.
